# Improved Glioma Grading using Deep Learning Techniques

### BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
	
 Gliomas are a sort of primary brain tumor that originates from glial cells. These cells are accountable for supporting the central nervous system of the human body. These tumors vary widely based on their nature, they could be either malignant or aggressive. Glioma grading is an essential part of diagnosis and treatment planning, as it can give critical information regarding the tumorâ€™s characteristics and its behavior. The main objective of this study is to use MR images and develop an attention-based deep learning model to detect glioma and visually locate the tumor. Additionally, machine learning models are deployed on the radiomic features, which are extracted from the MRI scans.
